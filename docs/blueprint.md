## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Green (#4CAF50), as specified by the user. This reflects the app's purpose in calculating and managing limits, aligning with concepts of progress and compliance.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), also specified by the user. A calm, neutral tone, reminiscent of legal documents or spreadsheet apps.
- Accent color: Blue (#4A86C3) for interactive elements and highlights. Selected as analogous to green, yet different enough in saturation and brightness to contrast well, promoting visual interest and usability.
- Body and headline font: 'Roboto', sans-serif. This was requested by the user. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use icons for dates, calendar, and calculation, to increase ease of use
- Display information in a clean, tabular format. Highlight key metrics like remaining days prominently.
- Subtle transition effects to show adding and removing contracts to signal user actions.
